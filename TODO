 - "semipublic" groups - anybody can try to connect, but connections must be approved by either admins or other users before they are allowed in the group
 - password-protected private groups
   - getting the password correct should add you to allowedusers
   - /invite should also add an id to allowedusers
 - reload config on sighup
   - make sure to disconnect from non-allowed users, banned users, etc.
 - accept config from either yaml file or command line (think viper has this built-in)
 - convenient way to run multiple group chats on one machine (probably just a matter of configuration)
 - unit tests
 - check if the stuff that rejects non-allowed users is actually robust (I have doubts)
 - a message to go along with kicks and bans (and store the ban messages in the ban list to display in /bans)
 - more concise & useful log output
 - what happens if there are 2 peers with the same onion address?
   - particularly, we need to make sure to disconnect all of them when kicking or banning!

admin commands still to implement:

    /invite $id   - invite given ricochet id to the chat (i.e. group chat should connect to that id and send a contactrequest)
    /welcome $msg - update the welcome message
    /admins       - list admins
    /allowedusers - list allowed users

Persistent state we still need to store:
 - welcome message
