This is a very early-stage work-in-progress towards a group chat server for Ricochet.

I'm not very good at either go or at using go-ricochet, so this is pretty crusty so far.
It's really just my way of learning how to use go and go-ricochet, so that later on I
can totally reimplement it in a really elegant way. I swear.
